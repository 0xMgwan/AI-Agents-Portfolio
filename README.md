# AI Agents for Blockchain & Social Interaction

## Overview

This repository contains various AI agents designed to interact with blockchain systems, social platforms (such as X/Twitter), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The agents are intended to simplify and enhance the experience of interacting with decentralized networks, savings groups, co-operatives, and social media through AI-driven automation and engagement.

## Types of Agents

### 1. Simple Agents

These agents are basic, standalone AI models designed for various tasks, including:

- Responding to user queries
- Processing simple transactions
- Managing basic user inputs/outputs

These agents act as the foundation for more complex agents, providing an easy entry point into the world of AI-driven interactions.

### 2. Social Interaction Agents (X/Twitter)

These agents interact with social platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), designed to:

- Automate social media interactions (likes, retweets, comments)
- Monitor feeds for specific topics and respond with predefined actions
- Engage with communities through AI-powered posts and replies

These agents help streamline user engagement and can be customized for community management, marketing campaigns, or customer support.

### 3. Blockchain Agents (Savings Groups, Co-Ops)

These agents interact with blockchain-based decentralized systems, such as savings groups and co-ops, by:

- Managing contributions and withdrawals in blockchain-based savings groups
- Facilitating co-op voting and decision-making processes
- Interfacing with smart contracts on supported blockchain platforms (e.g., Celo, Ethereum)
- Ensuring transparency and traceability in financial transactions

These agents aim to optimize decentralized governance and financial inclusion through automation and smart contract integration.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents.git
cd ai-agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
# Simple Agents
To use a simple agent, run the following script:

```bash
python simple_agent.py
```
This will start a basic agent capable of responding to commands and performing predefined actions.


## Social Interaction Agents (X/Twitter)
To interact with X (Twitter), you will need to set up API access. Follow these steps:
1. Create a Twitter Developer account and generate API keys.
2. Set up the environment variables for API credentials:

```bash
export TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
export TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret_key
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
```
3. Run the interaction agent:
```bash
python twitter_agent.py
```

## Blockchain Agents (Savings Groups, Co-Ops)
To use a blockchain agent, ensure that you have a supported blockchain environment set up (e.g., Celo or Ethereum). You will also need the relevant smart contract addresses and API keys.

1. Set up environment variables for blockchain credentials:
```bash
export BLOCKCHAIN_API_KEY=your_blockchain_api_key
export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
```
2. Run the blockchain interaction agent:
```bash
python blockchain_agent.py
```
